This is a django website its main purpose is to be a tinder for skill exchange 
basically if 2 people who admire eachothers skill meet they can then exchange them.

Backend is made of supabase database and for user authentication it uses a CustomUser created from django AbstractUser class.
This has a email confirmation with otp functionality and the rest is in progress

Potential improvements
- Adding a 1 to 1 chat feature preferably asynchronnous.
- Hosting the website as the database is already hosted.
